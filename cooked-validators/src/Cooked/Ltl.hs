-- * LTL formulas and operations on them

-- | Type of LTL formulas with atomic formulas of type @a@. Think of @a@ as a
-- type of "modifications", then a value of type @Ltl a@ describes where to
-- apply modifications. Since it does not make (obvious) sense to talk of a
-- negated modification or of one modification (possibly in the future) to
-- imply another modification, implication and negation are absent.
data Ltl a
  = -- | The "do nothing" modification that never fails
    LtlTruth
  | -- | The modification that never applies (i.e. always fails)
    LtlFalsity
  | -- | The modification that applies a given atomic modification at the current time step
    LtlAtom a
  | -- | Disjunction will be interpreted in an "intuitionistic" way, i.e. as
    -- branching into the "timeline" where the left disjunct holds and the one
    -- where the right disjunct holds. In that sense, it is an exclusive or,
    -- as it does not introduce the branch where both disjuncts hold.
    LtlOr (Ltl a) (Ltl a)
  | -- | Conjunction will be interpreted as "apply both
    -- modifications". Attention: The "apply both" operation will be
    -- user-defined for atomic modifications, so that conjunction may for
    -- example fail to be commutative if the operation on atomic modification is
    -- not commutative.
    LtlAnd (Ltl a) (Ltl a)
  | -- | Assert that the given formula holds at the next time step.
    LtlNext (Ltl a)
  | -- | Assert that the first formula holds at least until the second one begins
    -- to hold, which must happen eventually. The formulas
    -- > a `LtlUntil` b
    -- and
    -- > b `LtlOr` (a `LtlAnd` LtlNext (a `LtlUntil` b))
    -- are equivalent.
    LtlUntil (Ltl a) (Ltl a)
  | -- | Assert that the second formula has to be true up to and including the
    -- point when the first one becomes true; if that never happens, the second
    -- formula has to remain true forever. View this as dual to 'LtlUntil'. The
    -- formulas
    -- > a `LtlRelease` b
    -- and
    -- > b `LtlAnd` (a `LtlOr` LtlNext (a `LtlRelease` b))
    -- are equivalent.

  deriving (Show)

-- | Split an LTL formula that describes a modification of a computation into a
-- list of @(doNow, doLater)@ pairs, where
--
-- * @doNow@ is the modification to be applied to the current time step,
--
-- * @doLater@ is an LTL formula describing the modification that should be
--   applied from the next time step onwards, and
--
-- The return value is a list because a formula might be satisfied in different
-- ways. For example, the modification described by @a `LtlUntil` b@ might be
-- accomplished by applying the modification @b@ right now, or by applying @a@
-- right now and @a `LtlUntil` b@ from the next step onwards; the returned list
-- will contain these two options.
--
-- Modifications should form a 'Monoid', where 'mempty' is the do-nothing
-- modification, and '<>' is the composition of modifications. We interpret @a
-- <> b@ as the modification that first applies @b@ and then @a@. Attention:
-- Since we use '<>' to define conjunction, if '<>' is not commutative,
-- conjunction will also fail to be commutative!

--
-- * every step of the computations that returns a @b@ is reified as a @builtin
--   b@, and
--
-- * every step can be modified by a @modification@.

-- | Operations for computations that can be modified using LTL formulas.
data LtlOp (modification :: *) (builtin :: * -> *) :: * -> * where
  -- | The operation that introduces a new LTL formula that should be used to
  -- modify the following computations. Think of this operation as coming
  -- between time steps and adding a new formula to be applied before all of the
  -- formulas that should already be applied to the next time step.
  StartLtl :: Ltl modification -> LtlOp modification builtin ()
  -- | The operation that removes the last LTL formula that was introduced. If
  -- the formula is not yet 'finished', the current time line will fail.
  StopLtl :: LtlOp modification builtin ()

-- * Interpreting the AST

-- | To be a suitable semantic domain for computations modified by LTL formulas,
-- a monad @m@ has to
--
-- * have the right 'builtin' functions, which can be modified by the right
--   'modification's,
--
-- * be a 'MonadPlus', because one LTL formula might yield different modified
--   versions of the computation, and
--
-- This type class only requires from the user to specify how to interpret the
-- (modified) builtins. In order to do so, it passes around the formulas that
-- are to be applied to the next time step in a @StateT@. A common idiom to
-- modify an operation should be this:
--
-- > interpBuiltin op =
-- >  get
-- >    >>= msum
-- >      . map (\(now, later) -> applyModification now op <* put later)
-- >      . nowLaterList
--
-- (But to write this, @modification@ has to be a 'Monoid' to make
-- 'nowLaterList' work!) Look at the tests for this module and at
-- "Cooked.MockChain.Monad.Staged" for examples of how to use this type class.
class MonadPlus m => InterpLtl modification builtin m where
