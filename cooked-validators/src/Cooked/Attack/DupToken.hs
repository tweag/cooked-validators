-- | A token duplication attack increases values in 'Mints'-constraints of a
-- 'TxSkel' according to some conditions, and pays the extra minted value to a
-- given recipient wallet. This adds a 'DupTokenLbl' to the labels of the
-- transaction using 'addLabel'. Returns the 'Value' by which the minted value
-- was increased.
dupTokenAttack ::
  -- | A function describing how the amount of tokens specified by a 'Mints'
  -- constraint should be changed, depending on the asset class and the amount
  -- specified by the constraint. The given function @f@ should probably satisfy
  -- @f ac i > i@ for all @ac@ and @i@, i.e. it should increase the minted
  -- amount. If it does *not* increase the minted amount, the amount will be
  -- left unchanged.
  (L.AssetClass -> Integer -> Integer) ->
  -- | The wallet of the attacker. Any additional tokens that are minted by the
  -- modified transaction but were not minted by the original transaction are
  -- paid to this wallet.
