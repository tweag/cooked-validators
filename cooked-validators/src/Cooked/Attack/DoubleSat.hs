{- Note: What is a double satisfaction attack?

A double satisfaction attack consists in trying to satisfy the requirements for
what conceptually are two transactions in a single transaction, and doing so
incompletely. It succeeds whenever the requirements of two validators ovelap,
but the required outputs of the transaction are not sufficiently unique, so that
both validators see them as satisfying "their" requirement.

The mechanism is explained very well in the following analogy from the Plutus
documentation: "Suppose that two tax auditors from two different departments
come to visit you in turn to see if you’ve paid your taxes. You come up with a
clever scheme to confuse them. Your tax liability to both departments is $10, so
you make a single payment to the tax office’s bank account for $10. When the
auditors arrive, you show them your books, containing the payment to the tax
office. They both leave satisfied."

The double satisfaction attack 'doubleSatAttack' provided by this module works
by going through the foci of some optic on the 'TxSkel' representing the
transaction from the left to the right, and adding some extra 'Constraints'
depending on each focus and the current 'MockChainSt'ate. For example, we can
add

- one or more 'SpendsScript's, depending on 'SpendsScript' constraints on the original transaction,
- one or more 'Mints's, depending on a 'SpendsScript' on the original transaction,
- one or more 'SpendsScript's, depending on 'PaysScript' constraints on the original transaction,
- ...

-- | Double satisfacion attack. See the comment above for what such an attack is
-- about conceptually.
--
-- This attack consists in adding some extra constraints to a transaction, and
-- hoping that the additional minting policies or validator scripts thereby
-- involved are fooled by what's already present on the transaction. Any extra
-- value contained in new inputs to the transaction is then paid to the
-- attacker.

  -- | Each focus of this optic is a potential reason to add some extra
  -- constraints.
  --
  -- As an example, one could go through the 'PaysScript' constraints for
  -- validators of type @t@ with the following traversal:
  --
  -- > paysScriptConstraintsT % paysScriptConstraintTypeP @t
  Optic' k is TxSkel a ->
  -- | Which constraints to add, for each of the foci. There might be different
  -- options for each focus, that's why the return value is a list.
  --
  -- Continuing the example, for each of the focused 'PaysScript' constraints,
  -- you might want to try adding some 'SpendsScript' constraints to the
  -- transaction. Since it might be interesting to try different redeemers on
  -- these extra 'SpendsScript' constraints, you can just provide a list of all
  -- the options you want to try adding for a given 'PaysScript' that's already
  -- on the transaction.

  Wallet ->
  -- | Since there are potentially multiple 'Constraints' produced for each of
  -- the foci, the question is whether (and how) to combine additions that were
  -- triggered by different foci.
  --
  -- In the example: Let's say that the unmodified transaction had three focused
  -- 'PaysScript' constraints (let's denote them by a, b, and c), and that you
  -- want to try 2, 3, and 5 additional 'SpendsScript' constraints for each of
  -- them, respectively (let's call those a1, a2, and b1, b2, b3, and c1, c2,
  -- c3, c4, c5).
  --
  -- - If you want to try each additional 'SpendsScript' on its own modified
  --   transaction, use 'AllSeparate'. Thus, there'll be 2+3+5=10 modified
  --   transactions. Namely, for each element of the list
  --
  -- > [a1, a2, b1, b2, b3, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5]  ,
  --
  --   you'll get one modified transaction that includes that constraint.
  --
  -- - If you want to try combining all options from one focus with all options
  --   from all of the other foci, use 'TryCombinations'. Then, there'll be
  --   (2+1)*(3+1)*(5+1)=72 possible combinations, if you include all of the
  --   combinations where /at most/ three (one for each focus) extra constraints
  --   are added. One of these combinations is of course the one where nothing
  --   is added, and that one is omitted, which brings the grand total down to
  --   71 modified transactions, the additional 'SpendsScript' constraints of
  --   which are given by the following list:
  --
  -- > [ -- one additional constraint (the 10 cases from above)
  -- >   [a1],
  -- >   [a2],
  -- >   ...
  -- >   [c4],
  -- >   [c5],
  -- >
  -- >   -- two additional constraints, from different foci (2*3 + 2*5 + 3*5 = 31 cases)
  -- >   [a1, b1],
  -- >   [a1, b2],
  -- >   ...
  -- >   [b3, c4],
  -- >   [b3, c5],
  -- >
  -- >   -- three additional constraints, one from each focus (2*3*5 = 30 cases)
  -- >   [a1, b1, c1],
  -- >   [a1, b1, c2],
  -- >   ...
  -- >   [a1, b3, c4],
  -- >   [a1, b3, c5]
  -- > ]

  -- So you see that this attack can branch quite wildly. Use with caution!
