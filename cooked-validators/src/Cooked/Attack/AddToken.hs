-- | This attack adds extra tokens, depending on the minting policy. It is
-- different from the 'dupTokenAttack' in that it does not merely try to
-- increase the amount of tokens minted: It tries to mint tokens of asset
-- classes that were not necessarily present on the unmodified transaction.
--
-- This attack adds an 'AddTokenLbl' with the token name of the additional
-- minted token(s). It returns additional value minted.
addTokenAttack ::
  MonadTweak m =>
  -- | For each policy that occurs in some 'Mints' constraint, return a list of
  -- token names together with how many tokens with that name should be
  -- minted.
  --
  -- For each of the elements of the returned list, one modified transaction
  -- with the additional tokens will be generated. (This means for example that,
  -- if there were three minting policies on the original transaction, and the
  -- lists returned for each of them have n,m, and o elements, respectively,
  -- there'll be n*m*o modified transactions.)
  --
  -- The redeemer will be the one that's already being used on the transaction.
