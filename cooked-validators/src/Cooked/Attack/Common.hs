-- * The type of attacks

-- | The type of attacks that operate on a single transaction. The idea is that
-- in every 'MockChainSt'ate, there are number of possible modifications to a
-- transaction described by the given 'TxSkel'. Return @[]@ if the modification
-- does not apply. Use these attacks with the modalities from
-- 'MonadModalMockChain'.
type Attack = MockChainSt -> TxSkel -> [TxSkel]

-- * Constructing 'Attack's that return at most one modified transaction

-- | The simplest way to make an attack from an optic: Try to apply a given
-- function of type @a -> Maybe a@ to all foci of an optic, modifying all foci
-- that return @Just@. This attack returns a singleton list of the modified
-- 'TxSkel' if at least one modification was successful, i.e. if at least one of
-- the foci evaluates to @Just@; otherwise it returns @[]@.
mkAttack ::
  Is k A_Traversal =>
  -- | Optic focussing potentially interesting points to modify.
  Optic' k is TxSkel a ->
  -- | The modification to apply; return @Nothing@ if you want to leave the
  -- given focus as it is.

        Just y -> (y, True)
        Nothing -> (x, flag)
    )
    False
    (\_ skel flag -> [skel | flag])

-- | Traverse all foci of the given optic from the left to the right, while
-- counting the foci to which the modification successfully applies, and modify
-- only those modifiable foci whose index satisfies a given predicate. (This is
-- useful for example if you have many identical outputs on a transaction but
-- you only want to modify a few of them.) This attack returns a singleton list
-- of the modified 'TxSkel' if at least one modification was successful, i.e. if
-- at least one focus was modified; otherwise it returns @[]@.
mkSelectAttack ::
  Is k A_Traversal =>
  -- | Optic focussing potentially interesting points to modify.
  Optic' k is TxSkel a ->
  -- | The modification to apply; return @Nothing@ if you want to leave the
  -- given focus as it is.
  (a -> Maybe a) ->
  -- | Maybe the modification applies to (i.e. returns @Just@ on) more than one
  -- focus. Use this function to select the foci to modify by the order in which
  -- they are traversed. If you set this function to @const True@, you should
  -- probably use 'mkAttack', because that the semantic of that function.

-- * Constructing 'Attack's that return zero or more modified transactions

-- | This attack generates potentially very many modified TxSkels, or
-- potentially very few. For each focus, a list of possible modifications, each
-- with an associated label, is computed. The 'SplitStrategy' argument
-- determines how to combine modifications and labels.
--
-- By way of example, consider
--
-- > mkSplittingAttack strategy optic f g st skel
--
-- where @optic@ has three foci @x,y,z@ in @skel@. Assume that for each of these
-- foci, the lists of possible modifications together with their labels are
-- given by
--
-- > f st x = [(x1, 'a'), (x2, 'b')]
--
-- > f st y = [(y1, 'c'), (y2, 'd'), (y3, 'e')]
--
-- > f st z = []
--
-- The strategy 'OneChange' passes to @g@ all possible modifications of the
-- intial 'TxSkel' obtained by applying exactly one of the modifications. In the
-- example, this would mean 2 + 3 + 0 = 5 modified 'TxSkel's, namely the ones
-- corresponding to the following lists of (un)modified foci, together with
-- their (singleton) lists of labels:
--
-- > [ ([x1, y,  z], "a"),
-- >   ([x2, y,  z], "b"),
-- >   ([x,  y1, z], "c"),
-- >   ([x,  y2, z], "d"),
-- >   ([x,  y3, z], "e")
-- > ]
--
-- The strategy 'AllCombinations' passes to @g@ all modifications that change at
-- least focus. In the example, there are (2+1) * (3+1) * (0+1) = 12
-- combinations of applied and non-applied modifications, but one of them is the
-- one that leaves everything unchanged, which leaves us with the following 11:
--
-- > [ ([x,  y1, z], "c"),
-- >   ([x,  y2, z], "d"),
-- >   ([x,  y3, z], "e"),
-- >   ([x1, y,  z], "a"),
-- >   ([x1, y1, z], "ac"),
-- >   ([x1, y2, z], "ad"),
-- >   ([x1, y3, z], "ae"),
-- >   ([x2, y,  z], "b"),
-- >   ([x2, y1, z], "bc"),
-- >   ([x2, y2, z], "bd"),
-- >   ([x2, y3, z], "be")
-- > ]
