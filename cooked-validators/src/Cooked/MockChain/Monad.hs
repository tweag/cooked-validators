-- * BlockChain Monad

-- | Base methods for interacting with a UTxO graph through "Cooked.Tx.Constraints".
--  The operations within 'MonadBlockChain' have an implementation over the 'Plutus.Contract.Contract'
--  monad and can be used to build the first layer of off-chain code that
--  needs to interact with code in the @Contract@ monad.
--
-- It is strongly recomended that you write your code polymorphic for some monad @m@:
--
-- > f :: (MonadBlockChain m) => m ()
--
-- This enables you to choose different interpretations at run time. The two immediately interesting
-- interpretations are running your code within the
-- 'Plutus.Contract.Contract' monad to generate and submit transactions and to
-- test the code by running it in the 'Cooked.MockChain.Monad.Direct.MockChain' monad, provided in this library.
class (MonadFail m) => MonadBlockChain m where
  -- | Generates and balances a transaction from a skeleton, then attemps to validate such
  --  transaction. A balanced transaction is such that @inputs + mints == outputs + fees@.
  --  To balance a transaction, we need access to the current UTxO state to choose
  --  which inputs to add in case the output-side of the balancing equation is bigger.
  --
  --  The 'TxSkel' receives a 'TxOpts' record with a number of options to customize how validation works.

-- ** Slot and Time Management

-- $slotandtime
-- #slotandtime#
--
-- Slots are integers that monotonically increase and model the passage of time. By looking
-- at the current slot, a validator gets to know that it is being executed within a certain
-- window of wall-clock time. Things can get annoying pretty fast when trying to mock traces
-- and trying to exercise certain branches of certain validators; make sure you also read
-- the docs on 'autoSlotIncrease' to be able to simulate sending transactions in parallel.

-- ** Monad /Mock/ Chain: multiple identities

-- | The 'Plutus.Contract.Contract' monad has certain design decisions
-- that make it suboptimal for testing. Therefore, we divided the abstract
-- interface into those functions that have an interpretation in
-- 'Plutus.Contract.Contract' and those that do not.
--
-- For example, a function returning a value of type @Contract@ can be thought
-- of as an interaction with a plutus contract from a /single user/ point of view.
-- When testing, however, we might want to interact with a contract from multiple different users.
-- Changing the set of wallets that sign a transaction has no interpretation
-- in 'Plutus.Contract.Contract' and can only be used with the testing monads.

-- ** Deriving further 'MonadBlockChain' instances

-- | A newtype wrapper to be used with '-XDerivingVia' to derive instances of 'MonadBlockChain'
-- for any 'MonadTrans'.
--
-- For example, to derive 'MonadBlockChain m => MonadBlockChain (ReaderT r m)', you'd write
--
-- > deriving via (AsTrans (ReaderT r) m) instance MonadBlockChain m => MonadBlockChain (ReaderT r m)
--
-- and avoid the boilerplate of defining all the methods of the class yourself.
