Build Cardano transactions and interact with your [Plutus][plutus] validators.
Enables you to write the first layer of your off-chain code as if
you were using the `Contract` monad, but provides property-based tests
at the transaction level.

## A Quick Example

Say you followed the [tutorial on the Split][split-tuto] contract up to and including
the "Defining the validator script" section. At the end,
you should have a [`splitValidator`](../examples/src/Split.hs) function that
executes the _on-chain_ part of the Split contract.

Now, in order to interact with that contract, we need to write the _off-chain_ code
that generates and sends the necessary transactions to the blockchain. We can do
part of that with `cooked-validators`, in a very similar fashion to how we would do it
in the `Contract` monad. Instead of relying on the `Contract` monad directly, though,
we will use an arbitrary monad that is an instance of [`MonadBlockChain`](src/Cooked/MockChain/Monad.hs).

Locking funds is trivial, all we need to do is send the amount of funds we wish to lock
to the script:

```haskell
txLock :: (MonadBlockChain m) => SplitDatum -> m ()
txLock datum = void $ validateTxConstr
      [PaysScript splitValidator datum (Pl.lovelaceValueOf $ Split.amount datum)]
```

Note how `txLock` is defined for an arbitrary `m` such that `MonadBlockChain m`. In particular,
it is defined for `Contract`, for [`MockChain`](src/Cooked/MockChain/Monad/Direct.hs),
and also for [`StagedMockChain`](src/Cooked/MockChain/Monad/Staged.hs), which is what we will be using for
testing our `splitValidator`.

Unlocking funds is a little more interesting. To keep things simple we will unlock _the first_ split
datum which we're a recipient of.

```haskell
txUnlock :: (MonadBlockChain m) => m ()
txUnlock = do
  pkh <- ownPaymentPubKeyHash
  (output, datum@(Split.SplitDatum r1 r2 amount)) : _ <-
    scriptUtxosSuchThat splitValidator (isARecipient pkh)
  let half = div amount 2
  void $ validateTxConstr
      [ SpendsScript script () (output, datum),
        PaysPK r1 (Pl.lovelaceValueOf $ half),
        PaysPK r2 (Pl.lovelaceValueOf $ amount - half)
      ]
```

Here, we first get our own pubkey hash, then we select _the first output that belong to `splitValidator`_ such that
we are a recipient. If there is no such output, the pattern-match will fail and we will return an error.
The `isARecipient` predicate is defined as:

```haskell
isARecipient :: Pl.PubKeyHash -> SplitDatum -> a -> Bool
isARecipient pkh datum _ = pkh `elem` [recipient1 datum, recipient2 datum]
```

These two functions are what we could call the core of the _user interface_ of `splitValidator`. In fact, we can use them _as is_ to be our endpoints:

```haskell
endpoints :: (AsContractError e) => Promise w SplitSchema e ()
endpoints = endpoint @"lock" (txLock . mkSplitData)
   `select` endpoint @"unlock" (const txUnlock)
  where mkSplitData :: LockArgs -> SplitDatum
```

And, because `Contract w s e` is an instance of `MonadBlockChain`, thats all there is to it, you can just reuse your `MonadBlockChain` code without any modifications. But we're not interested in _just using it_. We also want
to make sure that our contract implementation is correct.

### Testing

When writing tests we're often interested in interacting with our validators from
the perspective of multiple wallets. That is where the `MonadMockChain` class comes in handy.
It provides us with the means to execute some `tr :: (MonadBlockChain m) => m ()` from different
wallets. For instance:

```haskell
-- Some contract functionality that gets used as part of
-- the production off-chain code
tr :: (MonadBlockChain m) => m ()
tr = do ...

-- In a testing scenario, runs @tr@ from Bob's wallet.
trByBob :: (MonadMockChain m) => m ()
trByBob = tr `as` bobWallet
```

#### Unit Tests

Let us start by writing a unit test that exercises our `splitValidator` and ensures that the execution succeeds:

```haskell
test1 :: TestTree
test1 = testCase "Simple trace succeeds" $ testSucceeds $ do
  txLock lockParams `as` wallet 1
  txUnlock `as` wallet 2
 where
  lockParams = SplitDatum (walletPKHash $ wallet 2) (walletPKHash $ wallet 3) 2_000_000
```

Here, we're executing `txLock lockParams` from `wallet 1`'s point of view, where we lock 2 ada to be
split amongst wallets 2 and 3, then we attempt to unlock as wallet 2. Our expectation is that this should
possible, hence we use `testSucceeds` which ensures that all the transactions in that trace succeeded.
It is worth noting that we are using _the same_ `txLock` and `txUnlock` that we used to
create our endpoints, but instantiated to a different type when testing.

#### Property-based Tests

Going from unit tests to property-based tests requires nothing but standard `QuickCheck`:
we use `Test.QuickCheck.forAll` to generate some parameters then specify our test using
the combinators from [`Cooked.MockChain.Testing`](src/Cooked/MockChain/Testing.hs).

Say that we wanted to lift `test1` above to a property-based test. We could do so by
writing a `Test1Params` record, then writing a function that maps a `Test1Params`
into a `MonadMockChain`. To make the code snippet shorter, lets use a 4-tuple
instead of defining a custom record:

```haskell
test2 :: TestTree
test2 = testProperty "Arbitrary simple trace succeeds" $
    forAll genParam $ \(w1, w2, amm, w') -> testSucceeds $ do
      let lockParams = SplitDatum (walletPKHash w1) (walletPKHash w2) amm
      txLock lockParams `as` w1
      txUnlock `as` w'
 where
  genParams = do
    w1  <-  wallet <$> choose (1, 9)
    w2  <- (wallet <$> choose (1, 9)) `suchThat` (/= w1)
    amm <- choose (2_000_000, 4_000_000) -- must be at least minAdaPerUTxO
    w'  <- oneOf [w1, w2]
    return (w1, w2, amm, w')
```

Which conveniently provides us with a `Tx`-level property-based test to check the correctness
of our `splitValidator`. Also worth noting here is that we're using the same `testSucceeds` predicate,
which in this case returns a `Test.QuickCheck.Property`.
In fact, `testSucceeds` has type `(IsProp prop) => StagedMockChain a -> prop` and lives under
[`Cooked.MockChain.Testing`](src/Cooked/MockChain/Testing.hs). All of the predicate combinators in
that module can be used with both `Test.HUnit` and `Test.QuickCheck` since we have
two `IsProp Assertion` and `IsProp Property` instances.

### Next Steps

The `cooked-validators` library can do much more than what was shown in this quick introduction,
we invite the interested parties to check the test for our [examples](../examples) contracts for
more.

## Guidelines

When writing functions with `cooked-validators`, the developer should follow some important guidelines
to make sure that the code remains testable. For example, it is strongly advised to _not_ use `guard`
in your `MonadBlockChain` functions. This could prevent a function from _even sending_ a transaction which,
although it might be what you want from a user-interface point of view, we certainly want to send
malformed transactions to study and test how the actual validators react. Instead, split your off-chain
code in (at least) two layers:

```haskell
txAction :: (MonadMockChain m) => ActionParms -> m ()
txAction x = do
  utxos <- findRelevantUTxos
  ... -- compute some relevant datums
  void $ validateTxConstr $
    [ PaysScript ...
    , SpendsPK ...
      ...
    ]

action :: ActionParms -> Contract w s ContractError ()
action x = guard (validParms x) >> txAction x
```

In this case, we can write expressive tests that execute some action even with potentially malformed
parameters, by using `txAction`. We only check for some internal consistency when defining the actual
code that will be used as part of our user interface.
