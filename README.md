This repository contains our collection of the libraries for developing and auditing [Plutus](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus) contracts.
These libraries are a research prototype under active development, they come
_as is_ with no guarantees whatsoever. Check the [license](LICENSE) for details.

## Documentation

The rendered Haddock for the current `main` branch can be found at [https://tweag.github.io/plutus-libs/](https://tweag.github.io/plutus-libs/)

## Projects

### [cooked-validators](cooked-validators)

- Used for writing the first layer of off-chain code: generating and submitting transactions.
- Enables property-based testing of Plutus contracts with no code duplication.
- Interacts seamlessly with Plutus `Contract` monad.
- Supports loading arbitrary UPLC contracts from bytestrings for testing.

### [examples](examples)

- Example contracts and their test suites written using `cooked-validators`

### [pirouette-plutusir](pirouette-plutusir)

- _Experimental instantiation of [pirouette](https://github.com/tweag/pirouette) for PlutusIR_.

## Developer Tools and Environment

A development environment can be obtained using `nix develop`.
With the default environment, you can compile the projects
with `cabal` and you also have access to Haskell development tools.
A minimal development environment is provided by `nix develop .#ci`.

### Seamless Integration with `direnv`

We recommend using [`direnv`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv#integrating-with-a-existing-flake)
to automatically bring in the nix dependencies when entering the project directory.

Several editors have support for `direnv`. If you use emacs, we recommend using [`envrc-mode`](https://github.com/purcell/envrc).

### Updating Plutus

Are you a contributor and would you like to bump the Plutus version we
are depending upon? Because we are _not_ pinning plutus with nix,
updating it's a little more manual but it's straightforward.

Our `cabal.project` file is a copy of the homonym file from
[plutus-apps](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/blob/main/cabal.project),
with the addition of `plutus-apps` themselves in there and a different list
of packages to build.

In order to bump plutus, you must:

1. Select the tag you want to update _to_ from `plutus-apps`.
2. Copy the `cabal.project` from there
3. Modify the `packages:` section to build our packages:
    ```
    packages:
      cooked-validators
      examples
    ```
4. Add the relevant setting for linking with libsodium:
    ```
    package cardano-crypto-praos
      flags: -external-libsodium-vrf
    ```
5. Add the `plutus-apps` dependency in there:
    ```
    source-repository-package
      type: git
      location: https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps.git
      tag: v2021-11-05 -- change the tag to whatever tag you need.
      subdir:
        freer-extras
        playground-common
        plutus-chain-index
        plutus-chain-index-core
        plutus-contract
        plutus-pab
        plutus-ledger
        plutus-use-cases
        quickcheck-dynamic
    ```
   In this case, we're running with `plutus-apps` at tag `v2021-11-05`.
6. Run `cabal build all` and grab a coffee, this will take a while.

### Pre-commit Hooks and CI

Our ci runs `ormolu` and `cabal test` for each of our subprojects.
In order to help avoid CI failures due to formatting problems, we recommend
that you install the [pre-commit hook for running ormolu](ci/ormolu-pre-commit-hook.sh).
To do so, simply copy (or link) the script into `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
