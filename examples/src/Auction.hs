Brief overview of the contract
------------------------------

There are four transactions involved in this contract:

1. Making an offer (off-chain implemented by 'txOffer'). Anyone who wishes to
   sell something can just pay it to the 'auctionValidator' with the 'Offer'
   datum specifiying the seller's address (which is the address that will at the
   end of the auction be paid the winning bid, or, if there have been no bids,
   receive the offer back) and the minimum bid. No checks are involved in this
   transaction.

The UTxO at the 'auctionValidator' that contains this initial offer
parameterises the rest of the auction. We shall call it the _offer UTxO_ of the
auction.

2. Setting the deadline of the auction (off-chain implemented by
   'txSetDeadline'). This transaction consumes the offer UTxO and returns an
   UTxO to the 'auctionValidator' with the 'NoBids' datum, which contains

   - the value originally offered, and

   - the thread NFT. This NFT ensures the authenticity of the auction from that
     point onwards, and its token name is uniquely derived from the offer UTxO
     (it is computed by 'tokenNameFromTxOutRef').

3. Bidding on the auction (off-chain implemented by 'txBid'). This transaction
   consumes an UTxO at the 'auctionValidator' with either 'NoBids' or 'Bidding'
   datum, and returns an UTxO with strictly greater value to the validator (in
   particular, it has to return the thread NFT) with a 'Bidding' datum recording
   the new highest bid and bidder. If there was a previous bidder, they are paid
   back their bid.

4. Hammer to end the auction (off-chain implemented by 'txHammer'). This
   transaction consumes an UTxO at the 'auctionValidator', and pays the Ada
   amount corresponding to the highest bid to the seller, and the value
   originally offered to the highest bidder. If there were no bids, the offer is
   returned to the seller.

Further details of these transactions are explained at the relevant places in
the code.

Remark on the design of the first two transactions
--------------------------------------------------

The following discussion is rather technical and not specific to this
contract. Rather, it describes a general design problem for smart contracts on
Cardano, so feel free to skip this if you merely want to get to know the
contract.

On a previous version of this contract, there was only one transaction to make
the offer and set the deadline. This caused the following problem, which we
think is fundamentally unsolvable: How do you ensure that some freshly minted
tokens end up at a specific validator, using only one transaction? -- If you want
to use only one transaction to mint some tokens with a policy P and make sure
that they end up at the correct validator V,

- the minting policy P has to know the address of V, which is the hash of V's
  (compiled and normalised) source code. In particular, there is no way to
  compute this address on-chain, which means that this can only be accomplished
  by parameterising the P the address of V.

- Conversely, the validator V needs to know the 'CurrencySymbol' of the thread
  token, which is the hash of the (compiled and normalised) code of P.

So, each of the two scripts P and V has to have the other's hash as a parameter,
and have it known at compile time. This is is patently an impossible cycle.

The only generic solution that we know of is to turn any initial payment of
freshly minted tokens to the validator into a two-transaction process: The first
transaction does not involve any checks at all, does not mint any tokens that
should be locked in the validator script, and creates "unchecked" UTxOs (Here,
these are the UTxOs with the 'Offer' datum). The second transaction consumes
unchecked UTxOs (with an additional redeemer, which here is 'SetDeadline'),
mints the required tokens, and pays a checked UTxO back to the same validator,
which contains the newly minted tokens as a proof of their soundness, and a
datum signalling that they have been checked (here, that datum is
'NoBids'). Since the second transaction uses a redeemer, it can make whatever
checks are needed to ensure the tokens are minted correctly and paid to the
correct script.

This solves the issue: The only thing that P has to enforce is that tokens are
only minted if a specific (unchecked) UTxO is spent on the same transaction. The
check that the tokens actually end up in V where they belong can be done by V
itself, using something like 'getContinuingOutputs' to find an output that has
the correct tokens.

-- * Data types

-- parameterised by is the currency symbol of the thread token, and that's only
-- a trick to get that currency symbol into the validator, because it can not be

-- file, you will find 'auctionValidator' defined with the constant currency
-- symbol derived from the 'threadTokenPolicy'.
